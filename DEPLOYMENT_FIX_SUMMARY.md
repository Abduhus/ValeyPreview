# Deployment Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the deployment errors encountered in the log file `logs.1757934570003.log`.

## Issues Identified

1. **Corrupt Binary File**: The file `dior-sauvage.jpg` in the assets directory was 0KB, causing the "Cannot read binary file" error (code 40400).

2. **Nixpacks Configuration Issue**: The `nixpacks.toml` file had an incorrect bash version specification that was causing build failures.

3. **Missing Local Assets**: The brand showcase component was referencing external URLs instead of local assets for Dior and Versace images.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Corrupt Binary File
- Deleted the 0KB file `client/src/assets/dior-sauvage.jpg`
- Downloaded a proper placeholder image and converted it to WebP format
- Updated the brand showcase component to use the local WebP image

### 2. Fixed Nixpacks Configuration
- Updated `nixpacks.toml` to use a compatible bash version specification
- Ensured proper installation of WebP tools during the build process

### 3. Updated Asset References
- Added imports for local images in `brand-showcase.tsx`:
  - `diorImage` from `../assets/dior-sauvage.webp`
  - `versaceImage` from `../assets/versace-eros.jpg`
- Updated hero slides to use local images instead of external URLs
- Updated the `getPerfumeBottleBackground` function to use local images

## Verification

- Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
- All assets are now properly referenced locally
- No more 0KB or corrupt files in the assets directory

## Deployment Recommendation

After these fixes, the application should deploy successfully to Railway. To deploy:

```bash
railway up
```

The deployment should now complete without the "Cannot read binary file" error.
