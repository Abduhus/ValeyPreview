# Product Grouping Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of product grouping functionality to merge perfumes with the same name but different bottle sizes into a single product card in the catalog view.

## Problem
Previously, perfumes with multiple size variants (e.g., 50ml, 100ml, 150ml) were displayed as separate product cards in the catalog, leading to:
- Cluttered product grid
- Confusing user experience
- Redundant product listings

## Solution
Implemented product grouping to display one card per unique perfume name, with size selection available within the product card and detail page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Product Grid Component ([client/src/components/product-grid.tsx](file:///C:/Games/ValleyPreview/client/src/components/product-grid.tsx))
- Modified to group products by name using `groupProductsByName()` function
- Created `uniqueProducts` array containing only one product per unique name
- Products within the same group are sorted by volume to ensure consistent selection of the "primary" product
- Maintains existing functionality for filtering, sorting, and search

### 2. Product Card Component ([client/src/components/product-card.tsx](file:///C:/Games/ValleyPreview/client/src/components/product-card.tsx))
- Already had support for `similarProducts` prop to display size options
- Shows "Size Options" section when multiple products with the same name exist
- Allows users to switch between sizes without leaving the product card
- Updates pricing, stock status, and other product information when size is changed

### 3. Product Detail Page ([client/src/pages/product-detail.tsx](file:///C:/Games/ValleyPreview/client/src/pages/product-detail.tsx))
- Already correctly implemented to find and display similar products with the same name
- Shows all available sizes in a selection panel
- Allows switching between sizes while maintaining the same product detail view

## Technical Approach
1. **Grouping Logic**: Products are grouped by their `name` field
2. **Primary Selection**: Within each group, products are sorted by volume (ml) and the smallest size is selected as the primary product
3. **Similar Products**: All other products in the same group are passed as `similarProducts` to the product card
4. **Display**: Only the primary product is rendered in the grid, but all size variants are accessible through the size selection interface

## Benefits
- **Cleaner UI**: Reduces visual clutter in the product catalog
- **Better UX**: Users can easily see all available sizes for a perfume without multiple clicks
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintains all existing functionality while improving organization
- **Performance**: Reduces the number of product cards rendered in the grid

## Example
For "CHRISTIAN DIOR HOMME INTENSE" which has three sizes (50ml, 100ml, 150ml):
- Previously: Three separate product cards
- Now: One product card showing "Size Options" with all three sizes

## Testing
The implementation has been verified to:
- Correctly group products by name
- Maintain existing filtering and sorting functionality
- Properly display size selection interfaces
- Preserve all existing product card features
