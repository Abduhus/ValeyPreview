# Deployment Asset Fix Instructions

## Issue
The deployed website was not displaying properly because asset files were not in the correct location for the server to serve them.

## Solution
Before each deployment, we need to ensure that all assets are copied to the root `assets` directory where the server expects them.

## Automated Fix Script
Create a script that automatically copies assets before building:

### For Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# deploy-assets-fix.ps1
Write-Host "Copying assets to root directory..."
xcopy client\public\assets\*.* assets\ /Y
Write-Host "Assets copied successfully!"

Write-Host "Building project..."
npm run build
Write-Host "Build completed!"

Write-Host "Ready for deployment!"
```

### For Unix/Linux/Mac (Bash)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-assets-fix.sh
echo "Copying assets to root directory..."
cp client/public/assets/* assets/
echo "Assets copied successfully!"

echo "Building project..."
npm run build
echo "Build completed!"

echo "Ready for deployment!"
```

## Updated Build Process
1. Copy assets: `xcopy client\public\assets\*.* assets\ /Y`
2. Build project: `npm run build`
3. Deploy to Render

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Check that images load on the homepage
2. Verify that the brand showcase section displays correctly
3. Confirm that all CSS and JavaScript assets are loading

This fix ensures that all static assets are in the correct location for the server to serve them properly.
