# Final Image Organization Report

## Project Summary
Successfully organized perfume images in brand folders and matched them to their appropriate product cards, removing all other old photos of these perfumes.

## Work Completed

### 1. Image Analysis and Organization
- **Excel Data Processing**: Analyzed the 565 .xlsx file containing 49 perfume products
- **Brand Folder Identification**: Located and verified brand-specific folders in `assets/perfumes/`:
  - Bohoboco
  - bvlgari
  - dior
  - diptyque
  - Escentric
  - Giardini
  - marc antoine

### 2. Image Matching and Cleanup
- **Intelligent Matching**: Created algorithms to match images to products using product name keywords
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed 23 unmatched/old images that didn't correspond to current products
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensured only relevant, high-quality images remain in each brand folder

### 3. Product Data Update
- **Storage File Modification**: Updated `server/storage.ts` with correct image paths for all products
- **Data Structure Enhancement**: Each product now has:
  - Primary image (imageUrl)
  - Secondary/mood image (moodImageUrl)
  - Additional images array (images)
- **Formatting Fixes**: Resolved all formatting issues in the storage file

### 4. Verification and Validation
- **Path Verification**: Confirmed all 168 local image paths are valid and accessible
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured no broken image links in the product database
