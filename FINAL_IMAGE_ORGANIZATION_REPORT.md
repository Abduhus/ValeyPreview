15. **FFFEFF** - 1 file (special case)

### 3. JSON Database Updates
- Updated image paths for all products in `processed-perfumes.json`
- Ensured all Signature Royale products have proper image assignments
- Verified that all image references point to the correct brand folders

### 4. Brand Filtering Fix
- Confirmed that client-side brand filtering is working correctly
- Verified that Signature Royale products are properly displayed when filtering by brand
- Ensured brand ID to brand name mapping matches between frontend and backend

## Verification

### Signature Royale Products
All Signature Royale products (IDs signature-royale-1 through signature-royale-9) now have:
- Proper image assignments
- Correct image paths pointing to `/assets/perfumes/SignatureRoyale/` folder
- Visibility in the catalog when filtering by the "signature-royale" brand

### Image Quality
- All images maintained their original quality during the organization process
- No images were lost or corrupted during the move
- File extensions were preserved (.webp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png)

## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Used
1. `organize-perfume-images-clean.js` - Initial organization script with comprehensive brand matching
2. `organize-remaining-images.js` - Secondary script to handle edge cases and remaining images
3. `update-image-paths.js` - Script to update image paths in the JSON database

### Brand Mapping
The following brand name to folder mapping was used:
```javascript
const brandFolderMapping = {
  'BOHOBOCO': 'Bohoboco',
  'BVLGARI': 'bvlgari',
  'CHANEL': 'chanel',
  'CHRISTIAN DIOR': 'dior',
  'CORETERNO': 'Coreterno',
  'DIPTYQUE': 'diptyque',
  'ESCENTRIC MOLECULE': 'Escentric',
  'GIARDINI DI TOSCANA': 'Giardini',
  'MARC ANTOINE BARRIOS': 'marc antoine',

  'RABDAN': 'Rabdan',
  'SIGNATURE ROYALE': 'SignatureRoyale',
  'VERSACE': 'Versace',
  'XERJOFF': 'Xerjoff'
};
```

## Results
