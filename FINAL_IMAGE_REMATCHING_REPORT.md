- Implemented proper naming convention handling

## Verification Results

- **Products Without Images**: 152 products still missing image assignments

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. Add Missing Images
- Populate the Versace brand folder with appropriate images
- Add more images for CHANEL products
- Complete the BVLGARI image collection

### 2. Refine Matching Algorithm
- Implement more sophisticated name matching for edge cases
- Add fuzzy matching for similar product names
- Create better handling for product variants

### 3. Quality Control
- Add validation to ensure all assigned images actually exist
- Implement automated testing for image paths
- Create reporting for unmatched products

## Technical Summary

### Scripts Created
1. `rematch-perfume-images-improved.ts` - Initial improved matching
2. `rematch-perfume-images-accurate.ts` - Brand-aware matching
3. `fix-rabdan-images.ts` - Targeted Rabdan product fixing
4. `cleanup-image-paths.ts` - Path correction utility

- Backup created as `processed-perfumes-rematched.json`

## Conclusion
The image rematching process has significantly improved the product data by assigning appropriate images to most products. The Rabdan and Signature Royale brands are now fully matched with their images. Further work is needed to complete the matching for other brands, particularly Chanel and Bvlgari.
