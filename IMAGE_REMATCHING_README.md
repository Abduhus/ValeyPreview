# Perfume Image Rematching Process

## Overview
This project involved rematching perfume images from brand-specific folders to their appropriate product cards in the Valley Preview application.

## Problem
The original product data had:
- Missing images for many products
- Incorrect image assignments (cross-brand assignments)
- Path issues with duplicate directories
- Inconsistent image URL formats

## Solution
We created a series of TypeScript scripts to:
1. Analyze the existing product data and image organization
2. Develop improved matching algorithms
3. Fix path issues and incorrect assignments
4. Validate the results

## Key Results
- **RABDAN Products**: 11/13 now have proper images assigned
- **SIGNATURE ROYALE Products**: All products have proper images
- **Overall**: 344 valid images verified, significant improvement in data quality

## Scripts
See `IMAGE_REMATCHING_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md` for detailed information about each script.

## Reports
See `FINAL_IMAGE_REMATCHING_REPORT.md` for comprehensive analysis of results.

## Files Updated
- `processed-perfumes.json` - Main product data file with improved image assignments
- Backup files created for safety

## Next Steps
1. Add missing images for brands like Versace
2. Continue improving matching for Chanel and Bvlgari products
3. Implement automated validation in the matching process
