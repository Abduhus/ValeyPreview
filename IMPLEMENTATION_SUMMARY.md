# Hero Carousel Image Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Current State
Your perfume e-commerce website's hero carousel currently uses:
- 3 high-quality local images (Tom Ford, YSL, Creed)
- 5 generic Unsplash images for other luxury brands (Chanel, Versace, Xerjoff, Dior, Armani)

## Enhancement Plan
To make your hero carousel more visually appealing and brand-consistent, we recommend:

### 1. Download Brand-Specific Images
Replace generic images with high-quality, brand-specific perfume bottle photography for:
- Chanel No. 5
- Versace Eros
- Xerjoff Aventus
- Dior Sauvage
- Armani Acqua di Gio

### 2. Optimize for Web Performance
- Resize all images to 1920x800px (matching current carousel dimensions)
- Convert to WebP format for smaller file sizes
- Maintain consistent visual quality across all slides

### 3. Update Component Implementation
Modify the [brand-showcase.tsx](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/client/src/components/brand-showcase.tsx) component to:
- Import new local images
