# Build Issue Fix for Render Deployment

## Problem
The deployment to Render was failing with the error:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two factors:
1. Vite and related build tools were in the `devDependencies` section instead of `dependencies`
2. Render was not installing `devDependencies` during the build process, and the build command wasn't running the actual build

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Build Tools to Dependencies
Moved the following build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in [package.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/package.json):
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- `autoprefixer`
- `postcss`
- `tailwindcss`
- `vite`

### 2. Updated Render Build Command
Updated [render.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/render.json) to explicitly install devDependencies during the build process and run the build:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

This ensures that:
1. All dependencies (including Vite) are installed during the build
2. Asset files are copied to the correct location
3. The build process runs successfully with `npm run build`

## Expected Outcome
After this fix, the Render deployment should complete successfully with:
- Vite being available during the build process
- All assets properly copied and served
- The website displaying correctly with all images and styling

The deployment will automatically trigger on Render after pushing these changes to the repository.
