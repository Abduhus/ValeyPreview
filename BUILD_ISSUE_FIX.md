# Build Issue Fix for Render Deployment

## Problem
The deployment to Render was failing with the error:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Vite and related build tools were in the `devDependencies` section
2. Render was not installing `devDependencies` during the build process
3. Even when using render.json, sometimes Render uses the default build command

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Build Tools to Dependencies
Moved the following build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in [package.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/package.json):
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- `autoprefixer`
- `postcss`
- `tailwindcss`
- `vite`
- `typescript`
- `tsx`

### 2. Updated Build Script
Modified the build script in [package.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/package.json) to ensure dev dependencies are installed:
```json
"build": "npm install --include=dev && vite build"
```

### 3. Updated Render Build Command
Updated [render.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/render.json) to explicitly install devDependencies during the build process:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

This ensures that:
1. All dependencies (including Vite) are installed during the build in multiple ways
2. Asset files are copied to the correct location
3. The build process runs successfully whether Render uses the default command or our custom command

## Expected Outcome
After this fix, the Render deployment should complete successfully with:
- Vite being available during the build process
- All assets properly copied and served
- The website displaying correctly with all images and styling

The deployment will automatically trigger on Render after pushing these changes to the repository.
