- Reporting of valid/invalid paths
- Identification of products without images

## Reports Generated

### 1. `IMAGE_REMATCHING_SUMMARY.md`
Initial summary of the rematching process results

### 2. `FINAL_IMAGE_REMATCHING_REPORT.md`
Comprehensive final report with detailed analysis

## Backup Files Created

Backup after initial rematching

### 2. `processed-perfumes-final.json`
Final backup after all corrections

## Process Summary

The image rematching process involved multiple iterations:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Understanding the existing data structure and image organization
2. **First Pass**: Basic rematching with improved algorithm
3. **Refinement**: Brand-aware matching to prevent cross-assignments
4. **Targeted Fixes**: Specific scripts for problematic brands (Rabdan)
5. **Path Correction**: Fixing duplicate directory issues
6. **Validation**: Verifying that all image paths are correct
7. **Reporting**: Creating comprehensive reports of results

## Results

### Before Processing
- Most products had no images or incorrect default images
- Image paths had various issues (duplicate directories, incorrect URLs)

### After Processing
- Rabdan products: 11/13 now have proper images
- Signature Royale products: All have proper images
- Other brands: Partially improved with more accurate matching
- Path issues: Significantly reduced
- Validation: 344 valid images confirmed

## Usage Instructions

To run any of these scripts:

```bash
npx ts-node script-name.ts
```

All scripts are designed to be safe and create backups of the original data before making changes.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Matching**: Implement fuzzy matching for better name recognition
2. **Automated Validation**: Integrate validation into the matching process
3. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for edge cases
4. **Performance**: Optimize for larger datasets
5. **Reporting**: Create more detailed analytics on matching success rates
