# Perfume Type Display Update - Summary

## Objective
Modify the product card to display perfume type (EDT, EDP, Cologne, etc.) instead of fragrance notes, while keeping fragrance notes on the product detail page.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Schema Update
- Updated the [Product](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/client/src/components/product-card.tsx#L7-L7) type definition in `shared/schema.ts` to include the `type` field
- This resolves TypeScript compilation errors

### 2. Product Card Component
- Replaced the "FRAGRANCE NOTES" section with a "PERFUME TYPE" display
- Shows the `selectedSize.type` value (EDT, EDP, COLOGNE, etc.)
- Maintains consistent styling with the previous design

### 3. Product Detail Page
- Preserved the complete "Fragrance Notes" section
- Users can still view detailed fragrance information on the product page

### 4. Data Structure
- Confirmed that processed perfume data includes the `type` field
- Values include: "EDT", "EDP", "COLOGNE", "PARFUM", etc.

## Verification
