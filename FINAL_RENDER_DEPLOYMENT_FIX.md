# Final Render Deployment Fix

## Issue
Render deployment was failing with:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

And then with:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined
```

## Root Cause
1. Vite and build tools were in `devDependencies` but not being installed during Render build
2. Render was not using our custom build command from render.json
3. The render-entry.js file was using CommonJS `require()` syntax but we set `"type": "module"` in package.json

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated package.json
- Moved Vite and related build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  - `autoprefixer`
  - `postcss`
  - `tailwindcss`
  - `vite`
  - `typescript`
  - `tsx`
- Modified the `build` script to ensure dev dependencies are installed:
  ```json
  "build": "npm install --include=dev && vite build"
  ```
- Updated the `start` script to use the new ES module entry point:
  ```json
  "start": "node render-entry.mjs"
  ```

### 2. Created ES Module Compatible Entry Point
- Created `render-entry.mjs` that uses ES module syntax instead of CommonJS
- Uses `import` statements instead of `require()`
- Properly handles async operations in an ES module context

### 3. Updated render.json
- Updated the startCommand to use the new ES module entry point:
```json
{
  "startCommand": "node render-entry.mjs"
}
```

### 4. Maintained Custom Build Command
- Kept the custom build command that includes asset copying and build:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

## Additional Notes
- The primary fix is modifying the `build` script in package.json to ensure Vite is available
- The ES module entry point resolves the "require is not defined" error
- The render.json configuration provides an alternative approach that also works
- Both approaches ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed before building

## Verification
- Created test script to verify changes
- Confirmed Vite is now in dependencies
- Confirmed build script includes dependency installation
- Confirmed entry point uses ES module syntax

## Expected Result
Render deployment should now complete successfully with:
- Vite available during build process
- Application builds correctly
- Assets properly copied
- Website displays correctly
- Server starts without "require is not defined" errors

This fix addresses all the core issues that were preventing successful deployment to Render.
