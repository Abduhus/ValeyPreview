# Final Render Deployment Fix

## Issue
Render deployment was failing with:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

## Root Cause
1. Vite and build tools were in `devDependencies` but not being installed during Render build
2. Render build command was not executing the actual build process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated package.json
- Moved Vite and related build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  - `autoprefixer`
  - `postcss`
  - `tailwindcss`
  - `vite`
  - `typescript`
  - `tsx`

### 2. Updated render.json
- Added `npm run build` to the build command:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

### 3. Verified Dockerfile
- Confirmed Dockerfile already handles devDependencies correctly for build process

## Verification
- Created test script to verify changes
- Confirmed Vite is now in dependencies
- Confirmed build command includes `npm run build`

## Expected Result
Render deployment should now complete successfully with:
- Vite available during build process
- Application builds correctly
- Assets properly copied
- Website displays correctly

This fix addresses the core issue that was preventing successful deployment to Render.
