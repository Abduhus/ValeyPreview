# Final Render Deployment Fix

## Issue
Render deployment was failing with:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

## Root Cause
1. Vite and build tools were in `devDependencies` but not being installed during Render build
2. Render build command was not executing the actual build process
3. Render was using the default `npm run build` command instead of the custom build command in render.json

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated package.json
- Moved Vite and related build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  - `autoprefixer`
  - `postcss`
  - `tailwindcss`
  - `vite`
  - `typescript`
  - `tsx`
- Modified the `build` script to ensure dev dependencies are installed:
  ```json
  "build": "npm install --include=dev && vite build"
  ```

### 2. Updated render.json
- Kept the custom build command that includes asset copying and build:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

### 3. Verified Dockerfile
- Confirmed Dockerfile already handles devDependencies correctly for build process

## Additional Notes
- The primary fix is modifying the `build` script in package.json to ensure Vite is available
- The render.json buildCommand provides an alternative approach that also works
- Both approaches ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed before building

## Verification
- Created test script to verify changes
- Confirmed Vite is now in dependencies
- Confirmed build command includes dependency installation

## Expected Result
Render deployment should now complete successfully with:
- Vite available during build process
- Application builds correctly
- Assets properly copied
- Website displays correctly

This fix addresses the core issue that was preventing successful deployment to Render by ensuring Vite is available regardless of how Render executes the build.
