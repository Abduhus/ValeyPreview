# Final Fix for Render Deployment Issue

## Problem
The ValleyPreview perfume e-commerce website deployment to Render was failing with the error:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that Vite was in the `dependencies` section of [package.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/package.json) instead of `devDependencies`, and Render wasn't installing devDependencies during the build process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Vite to DevDependencies
Moved Vite and related build tools from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` in [package.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/package.json):
- `vite`
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- `autoprefixer`
- `postcss`
- `tailwindcss`

### 2. Updated Render Build Command
Modified [render.json](file:///c:/Games/ValleyPreview/render.json) to explicitly install devDependencies during the build process:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && xcopy client\\public\\assets\\*.* assets\\ /Y && npm run build"
}
```

## Expected Outcome
After this fix, the Render deployment should complete successfully with:
- Vite being available during the build process
- All assets properly copied and served
- The website displaying correctly with all images and styling

The deployment will automatically trigger on Render after pushing these changes to the repository.

## Commit Information
The fix has been committed to the repository with commit hash: 3193f7e

Title: "Fix Vite build issue by moving Vite to devDependencies and updating Render build command"

This should resolve the "vite: not found" error and allow the website to deploy successfully to Render.
