# Perfume Image Rematching Summary

## Objective
Rematch perfume images based on the new entries, considering the perfume type, name, and brand to ensure every image goes to its appropriate product card.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Issues Identified
- Directory naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Rabdan" vs "rabdan")
- Some brands had multiple directories with different casing
- Image matching algorithm needed improvement for better accuracy

### 2. Improved Rematching Script
Created `improved-rematch-perfume-images.js` with enhanced features:
- Case-insensitive brand directory matching
- Better image matching algorithm based on perfume name and type
- Special handling for brands like Rabdan with generic image naming
- Proper assignment of primary, mood, and additional images

### 3. Results
- Successfully rematched images for all perfumes
- Improved matching accuracy for brand-specific perfumes
- Proper handling of case-sensitive directory issues
- Maintained existing image structure while improving assignments

### 4. Verification
- Chanel perfumes: Properly matched with specific variant images
- Rabdan perfumes: Correctly assigned specific images to each variant
- Other brands: Improved matching based on name and type
- Product cards: Continue to display perfume type correctly

### 5. Data Structure
The processed perfumes data now includes properly matched images:
```json
{
  "id": "rabdan-2",
  "name": "CIGAR HONEY",
  "brand": "RABDAN",
  "type": "EDP",
  "imageUrl": "/assets/perfumes/RABDAN/Rabdan_CIGAR_HONEY_1.webp",
  "moodImageUrl": "/assets/perfumes/RABDAN/Rabdan_CIGAR_HONEY_2.webp",
  "images": "[]"
}
```

### 6. Brand-Specific Improvements
- **Chanel**: Enhanced matching for variants like ALLURE HOMME, ALLURE HOMME EDITION BLANCHE, etc.
- **Rabdan**: Specific image assignment for each variant (CIGAR HONEY, GINGER TIME, etc.)
- **Other Brands**: Improved matching based on perfume names and types

### 7. Technical Implementation
- Fixed directory path issues with case-insensitive matching
- Enhanced image matching algorithm to consider perfume names, types, and variants
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data structure
- Preserved product card functionality (perfume type display)

## Conclusion
The image rematching process has been successfully completed with significant improvements:
1. All perfume images are now properly matched to their respective product cards
2. Directory naming inconsistencies have been resolved
3. Brand-specific image matching has been enhanced
4. The product card continues to display perfume type instead of fragrance notes
5. Product detail pages still show complete fragrance information

The implementation ensures that customers will see the most appropriate images for each perfume variant, improving their shopping experience while maintaining the technical integrity of the application.
