## Previous Issues Resolved

1. **Dockerfile Configuration**: Fixed file copying between build stages that was causing "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" errors
2. **Nixpacks Configuration**: Cleaned up the nixpacks.toml file with proper TOML syntax
3. **Bash Version Compatibility**: Removed problematic bash version specification that was incompatible with Alpine Linux
4. **Start Script Logic**: Corrected asset directory paths and simplified Railway deployment logic
5. **Module Resolution**: Verified that dist/server/index.cjs is properly generated and accessible

## Expected Outcome

With the fixes applied, the deployment should now complete successfully without the previous errors. The application should be accessible once the build and deployment process is complete.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the build logs at the provided URL
2. Wait for the deployment to complete
3. Verify the application is accessible at the Railway-provided URL
4. Test key functionality such as product catalog, shopping cart, and search features

## Troubleshooting

If any issues occur during the deployment:

1. Check the build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in Railway
3. Confirm the PORT variable is being used correctly
4. Ensure the server is binding to 0.0.0.0 interface
