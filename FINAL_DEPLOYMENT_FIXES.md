# Final Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the deployment errors encountered in the log file `logs.1757949593060.log`.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Bash Executable**: The error "The executable `bash` could not be found" occurred because the Dockerfile's production stage wasn't properly installing bash before trying to run the start script.

2. **Incorrect Builder Configuration**: The railway.json was configured to use NIXPACKS, but we have a custom Dockerfile that should be used instead.

3. **Shell Script Compatibility**: The start script was using `#!/bin/sh` shebang, but the Railway environment expects bash.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Configuration
- Updated the Dockerfile to explicitly install bash in the production stage
- Changed the CMD instruction from `["./start.sh"]` to `["bash", "./start.sh"]` to ensure bash is used to execute the script

### 2. Updated railway.json Configuration
- Changed the builder from "NIXPACKS" to "DOCKERFILE"
- Specified the dockerfilePath as "Dockerfile"
- Updated the startCommand to "./start.sh" to match the Dockerfile

### 3. Improved Shell Script Compatibility
- Changed the shebang line in start.sh from `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/bin/bash` for better compatibility

## Verification Steps

1. The Dockerfile now properly installs bash in both build and production stages
2. The railway.json correctly references the Dockerfile as the build method
3. The start script is now explicitly executed with bash

## Deployment Recommendation

After these fixes, the application should deploy successfully to Railway. To deploy:
