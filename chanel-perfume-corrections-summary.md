# Chanel Perfume Image Correction Summary

## Overview
I have analyzed and corrected image assignments for Chanel perfumes in the processed-perfumes-updated.json file. The main issues were:
1. Cross-contamination of images between different product lines
2. Incorrect product type labeling (EDT vs COLOGNE)
3. Mixed images from different concentrations within single product entries

## Corrections Made

### 1. ALLURE HOMME (EDT)
- **ID 100 (150ml)**
- **Issue**: Contained images from Blanche edition and Sport variants
- **Correction**: Removed all cross-product images, kept only EDT-specific images
- **Result**: Now contains only appropriate EDT images

### 2. ALLURE HOMME SPORT
- **ID 104 (50ml EDT)**
  - Fixed product name from "COLOGNE (M) EDT" to "(M) EDT"
  - Assigned correct EDT images
- **ID 105 (100ml COLOGNE)**
  - Fixed product name from "COLOGNE (M) EDT" to "(M) COLOGNE"
  - Assigned correct COLOGNE images
- **ID 106 (150ml COLOGNE)**
  - Fixed product name from "COLOGNE (M) EDT" to "(M) COLOGNE"
  - Assigned correct COLOGNE images
- **ID 107 (50ml COLOGNE)**
  - Fixed product name from "COLOGNE (M) EDT" to "(M) COLOGNE"
  - Assigned correct COLOGNE images

### 3. CHANCE Line
- **ID 120 (100ml EDP)**
  - Assigned correct EDP images
  - Removed EDT and Eau Tendre images
- **ID 122 (100ml EDT)**
  - Assigned correct EDT images
  - Removed EDP and Eau Tendre images
- **ID 123 (150ml EDT)**
  - Assigned correct EDT images
  - Removed EDP and Eau Tendre images
- **ID 124 (50ml EDT)**
  - Assigned correct EDT images
  - Removed EDP and Eau Tendre images

## Key Improvements
1. **Product Type Accuracy**: Fixed inconsistent naming where products were labeled as COLOGNE but described as EDT
2. **Image Segregation**: Ensured each product variant only contains images appropriate to its specific formulation
3. **Consistency**: Maintained consistent image sets across different volumes of the same product type

## Benefits
- Customers will now see accurate product images that match the specific fragrance variant
- Reduced confusion between different concentrations and editions
- Improved product presentation and shopping experience
- Better alignment between product descriptions and visual representations

These corrections ensure that each Chanel perfume product has the correct images that match their specific fragrance type and presentation, resolving the issues of using cologne photos on EDT perfumes and cross-contamination between different product variants.
